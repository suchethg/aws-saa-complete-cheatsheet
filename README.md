## 📖 About These Notes

I've created these notes during my **AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Associate (SAA-C03)** exam preparation and used them heavily during revision — going through each section multiple times to reinforce concepts, memorize key differences, and drill exam traps. These notes were built alongside my learning and practice tests, with AI helping me articulate and consolidate concepts as I studied.

What makes these notes useful:
- **Exam-focused:** Every table, comparison, and callout is written with the exam in mind — not theory, but what you actually need to answer questions correctly
- **High-signal, low-noise:** Covers the right depth — enough to understand, not so much you get lost
- **Comparison-heavy:** The trickiest exam questions test your ability to distinguish similar services — this guide is built around those distinctions
- **Battle-tested:** These are the exact notes I revised with before passing the exam

I'm happy to help fellow AWS learners — feel free to use these as your revision companion, share them, or open an issue if you spot anything outdated.

## 🚀 How to Use These Notes

### Recommended Study Path

This is how I approached my prep — adapt it to what works for you:

1. **Take a video course first** — I went through Stephane Maarek's AWS SAA course on Udemy (highly recommended). After each section in the course, come back and read the corresponding notes here to reinforce what you just learned.
2. **Do hands-on practice** — Reading isn't enough. Make sure to get hands-on experience in the AWS console by building small test projects or doing labs to cement the concepts in your mind.
3. **Use these notes for revision** — Once you've completed the course, go through all 26 sections here as your revision guide. Pay extra attention to sections 24 (Common Confusions) and 26 (Quick Reference) — they are highest-yield for the exam.
4. **Do practice exams** — This is non-negotiable. Tutorial Dojo's SAA practice tests and Stephane Maarek's practice exams are both excellent and very close to the real exam style. Score consistently above 80% before booking.
5. **Day before the exam** — Only review section 26 (Quick Reference): key numbers, service selection summaries, and final exam-day tips.

### Reading the Callouts

Each section uses consistent callout formatting:

- **⚠️ EXAM TRAP** — The most commonly missed concepts; these directly address wrong answer choices
- **💡 TIP** — Practical exam strategy and "when to use what" guidance
- **🧠 MNEMONIC** — Memory aids for complex comparisons (e.g., "C = CPU crunching" for Compute Optimized)
- **📌 NOTE** — Additional context before answers in practice questions

### Navigation

Every section file has **← prev | README | next →** links at the bottom so you can move through sections without coming back to this page.

Feel free to **fork** or **⭐ star** this repo to keep it bookmarked so you can easily come back for your revision rounds!
